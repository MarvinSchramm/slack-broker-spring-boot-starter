= Events

To receive slack-events, you have to configure events on your slack-app like described in the <<getting-started#event-guide,Getting Started Guide>>.
Then create a Component that implements the https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/starter/slack-spring-boot/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/broker/receiver/EventReceiver.kt[EventReceiver-interface].
Example:

[source,kotlin]
--
include::../../../../../../samples/slack-spring-boot-starter-sample/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/sample/rock_paper_scissors/RockPaperScissorsChannelListener.kt[lines=13..-1]
--

In this Receiver, we override the supportsEvent()-method to ensure, that the received message should be handled by this receiver.
In our example, we only want to listen to messages that are equal to "rock", "paper", "scissors" or "rock paper scissors".
The onReceiveEvent()-method then checks which string was sent, and responds to it, depending to the content.
When the user sent "rock", "paper" or "scissors" the bot chooses a random weapon and evaluates the winner of this game.
If the user sent "rock paper scissors" the bot starts a new game with buttons with which you can choose your weapon.
