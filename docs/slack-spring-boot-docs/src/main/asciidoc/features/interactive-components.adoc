= Interactive Components

To use Interactive components, configure the slack app like it is described in the <<getting-started#interactivecomponent-guide,Getting Started Guide>>.
Now create a new component in your spring boot application that implements the https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/starter/slack-spring-boot/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/broker/receiver/InteractiveComponentReceiver.kt[InteractiveComponentReceiver].

Example:

[source,kotlin]
--
include::../../../../../../samples/slack-spring-boot-starter-sample/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/sample/rock_paper_scissors/RockPaperScissorsSubmissionReceiver.kt[lines=11..-1]
--

Because we want to retrieve the submission of a BlockComponents, we implement the receiver with the BlockActions type.
We override the supportsInteractiveMessage()-method to ensure, that the received submission should be handled by this receiver.
In the onReceiveInteractiveMessage()-method, we simply call the rpsGameHandler to evaluate the result of the played game.
