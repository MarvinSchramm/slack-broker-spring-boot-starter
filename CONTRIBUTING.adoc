* Create a `.sample()` extension for every created dto in the https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/tree/master/data/slack-jackson-dto-test-extensions/src/main/kotlin/io/olaph/slack/dto/jackson[slack-jackson-dto-test-extension] package, which simply returns a created object with empty values


Bugs
~~~~~
