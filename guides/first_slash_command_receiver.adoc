:source-highlighter: highlightjs

To write your first command receiver you need to write a component that implements the link:https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/starter/slack-spring-boot/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/broker/receiver/SlashCommandReceiver.kt[SlashCommandReceiver] interface, you can use the  link:https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/client/slack-api-client/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/api/SlackClient.kt[SlackClient] that is automatically registered with the starter

Example Ping Receiver that answers with a pong an immediately updates the response to "pong"

This Receiver overrides the `supportsCommand(`-method to ensure that it is only invoked when /ping is executed

the https://github.com/kreait/slack-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/starter/slack-spring-boot/src/main/kotlin/com/kreait/slack/broker/broker/EventBroker.kt[EventBroker] takes care of receiving the slashcommand and forwards it to the right Receiver
