== App Credentials


while developing your application, you probably dont want to implement the 'Add to Slack'-Button on a landing page yet.
There are 2 possibilities to install your bot, to ensure that the oauth flow is correctly handled.
(the initial installation on your development workspace is not enough to run the whole oauth flow).
First, you have to setup a Redirect-Url, therefore, go to the https://api.slack.com/apps[Slack App Console].
Under 'Oauth & Permissions' you have to add an url to your service or tunnel-service with the endpoint /installation.
e.g. if you use ngrok: 'https://my-awesome-bot.eu.ngrok.io/installation'


there are two possibilities to install your application, and trigger the Oauth flow.

1. Via Slack App console
- go to the https://api.slack.com/apps[Slack App Console] - Manage Distribution
- there you find the generated Installation Button, it already contains the permissions that your app needs.
- if you want to generate a button with different permissions than your app needs (development purposes only) you can generate it in the https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button[Slack Documentation]

2. Via Sharable Link
- if you want to let someone else install your app (probably for debugging/testing purposes you dont want to do on the production system) use the 'Shareable Link' under https://api.slack.com/apps[Slack App Console] - Manage Distribution
